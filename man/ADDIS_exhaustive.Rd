\title{ADDIS-exhaustive: Exhaustive ADDIS-spending procedure for online FWER control}
\usage{
ADDIS_exhaustive(d, alpha = 0.05, tau = 0.5, lambda = 0.25, gamma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Either a vector of p-values, or a dataframe with at least a
`pval` column (and optionally `id`).}

\item{alpha}{Overall significance level of the procedure, default 0.05.}

\item{tau}{Optional threshold for hypotheses to be selected for testing.
Must be between 0 and 1, defaults to 0.5.}

\item{lambda}{Optional parameter that sets the threshold for `candidate'
hypotheses. Must be between 0 and tau, defaults to 0.25.}

\item{gamma}{Optional vector of initial weights. If `NULL` (the default),
a decreasing sequence proportional to j^(-1.6) is used, as in ADDIS().}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the original p-values `pval`, the per-hypothesis
  testing levels `alphai`, and the indicator of discoveries `R`.
}
\description{
Implements an exhaustive variant of the ADDIS-spending algorithm for online
FWER control, as presented by Fischer et al. (2023). The procedure is a 
uniform improvement of ADDIS-spending, and no other FWER controlling
procedure can enlarge the event of rejecting any hypothesis.
}
\details{
The function takes as its input either a vector of p-values, or a dataframe
with two columns: an identifier (`id') and p-value (`pval'). Given an overall
significance level \eqn{\alpha}, ADDIS-exhaustive depends on constants
\eqn{\lambda} and \eqn{\tau}, where \eqn{\lambda < \tau}. Here \eqn{\tau \in
(0,1)} represents the threshold for a hypothesis to be selected for testing:
p-values greater than \eqn{\tau} are implicitly `discarded' by the procedure,
while \eqn{\lambda \in (0,1)} sets the threshold for a p-value to be a
candidate for rejection: ADDIS-exhaustive will never reject a p-value larger
than \eqn{\lambda}. The algorithms also require a sequence of non-negative
non-increasing numbers \eqn{\gamma_i} that sum to 1.

The ADDIS-exhaustive procedure provably controls the FWER in the strong sense
for independent p-values.
